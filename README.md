### Hello there!

#### My name is Kelly, and I'm a fullstack software engineer.
I graduated from **Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive** in December of 2021 and I've since fallen in love with the craft. 
I currently specialize in TypeScript and React, though I've recently picked up a few tricks with Ruby on Rails and Apollo/GraphQL.

When I'm not coding, I'm most likely out for dinner at the newest restaurant on the block or trying to lure a stray cat inside my house (forever).

#### Here are some of the projects I created as a student:
[Marxet](https://github.com/kellytso04/marxet) is a project I'm very proud of. For this capstone, I took on the role of **UI Owner** and was responsible for designing the look, layout, and feel of our entire application. It gave me an opportunity to take on a leadership role and also flex my Excalidraw skills at the same time. Win-win.

[Doowell](https://github.com/kellytso04/doowell) was a difficult one. I was given less than 48 hours to dream up, design, and build a full-stack application. It really pushed my time-management and perseverance to the limit, and I'm still very proud of what I was able to produce in such a small timeframe.

[Catwalk](https://github.com/team-parakeet/catwalk) was my first experience working in a team as opposed to just a pair during my time in the immersive. Every day I walked in and did valorous battle with CSS (I won almost every time). It was a crash course in the nitty-gritty of Git workflow and best collaborative practices.
