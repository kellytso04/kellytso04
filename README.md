### Hello there!

#### My name is Kelly, and I'm a fullstack software engineer.
I graduated from **Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive** in December of 2021 and I've since fallen in love with the craft.

I'm currently serving as a Resident under the same program that trained me, so you'll see a lot of repositories that I've created to be workshops for my students to really hone their skills and ensure their fundamentals are solid.

#### I'm currently working on...
- TypeScript and Ruby on Rails! I'm employing everything I learned about autonomy on Hack Reactor and teaching myself the ins and outs of both.
- My own personal [website](https://github.com/kellytso04/dot-io) because I've always wanted one
- Finding a full-time job as a software engineer! 

#### Here are some of my favorite projects so far:
[Marxet](https://github.com/kellytso04/marxet) is a project I'm very proud of. For this capstone, I took on the role of **UI Owner** and was responsible for designing the look, layout, and feel of our entire application. It gave me an opportunity to take on a leadership role and also flex my Excalidraw skills at the same time. Win-win.

[Doowell](https://github.com/kellytso04/doowell) was a difficult one. I was given less than 48 hours to dream up, design, and build a full-stack application. It really pushed my time-management and perseverance to the limit, and I'm still very proud of what I was able to produce in such a small timeframe.

[Catwalk](https://github.com/team-parakeet/catwalk) was my first experience working in a team as opposed to just a pair during my time in the immersive. Every day I walked in and did valorous battle with CSS (I won almost every time). It was a crash course in the nitty-gritty of Git workflow and best collaborative practices.
